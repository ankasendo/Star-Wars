 ### User preference
 I wanted the website to be aesthetically pleasing while using colours that are related to Star Wars theme. I wanted to keep the design minimal to not overwhelm the user while still being enjoyable to look at.
I wanted the user to be able to jusmp straight into the quiz with minimal navigation or extra pages blocking their path. I wanted this quiz to offer various questions that can be easy as well as challenging. T

 ### 1. Strategy

 ### 2. Scope

 ### 3. Structure

 ### 5. Surface

 * Colours

 I have paid a lot of attention to the color scheme. And used 3 colors throught the website. we've chosen Yellow, Blue as it is a good match for Star Wars scheme,and Black to contrast yellow and blue. 
 * Font Selection
 * Google font
 I've used 'Poller one' for the main font. This was done to match font known to Star Wars.
 * The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Potential Future Features

* A Timer  
      - A running timer during the activity could add some pressure and excitment to the challenge. Making the user more likely to continue replayability.

* Online Leaderboard
      - I would like to make the Leaderboard work and host online, this would connect more users and add even more challenge once more questions were added.

* Contact the Developer
      - This would be a way that the user could give more ideas on extra questions, or a way for them to report any bugs that they may have found.
