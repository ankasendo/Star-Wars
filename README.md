# UX

![screenshot]

[screenshot]:/assets/images/responsive-b%20.png

 ### User preference
 I wanted the website to be aesthetically pleasing while using colours that are related to Star Wars theme. I wanted to keep the design minimal to not overwhelm the user while still being enjoyable to look at.
I wanted the user to be able to jusmp straight into the quiz with minimal navigation or extra pages blocking their path. I wanted this quiz to offer various questions that can be easy as well as challenging. T

 ### 1. Strategy 
 * Project Purpose
    *    To provide the target user with informative and fun quiz questions .

 ### 2. Scope
 * I wanted a simple, straightforward UX experience.
 * I wanted a bright fun color scheme.
 * I wanted my content to be clear for all users. 
 * I wanted a site that is visually appealing on most devices.

 ### 3. Structure
 *	A clear layout is in place to ensure users can immediately start the quiz.
 *  Multiple choice questions for faster interface

 ### 5. Surface

 * Colours

 I have paid a lot of attention to the color scheme. And used 3 colors throught the website. we've chosen Yellow, Blue as it is a good match for Star Wars scheme,and Black to contrast yellow and blue. 
 * Font Selection
 * Google font
 I've used 'Poller one' for the main font. This was done to match font known to Star Wars.
 * The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


# Technologies

 The technologies used in this project were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML was used to create the structure of the page, the CSS was used to style the page and the JavaScript was used to make the entire quiz function.

 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JavaScript
 * GitHub

 ### Programmes Used

*   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
      - Used to import specific fonts.
*   [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
      - Used to add icon.
*   [GitHub](https://github.com/)
      - Used as the respository for the project code after being pushed from Git.
*   [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
      - Used to validate HTML.

### Potential Future Features

* A Timer  
      - A running timer during the activity could add some pressure and excitment to the challenge. Making the user more likely to continue replayability.

* Online Leaderboard
      - I would like to make the Leaderboard work and host online, this would connect more users and add even more challenge once more questions were added.

* Contact the Developer
      - This would be a way that the user could give more ideas on extra questions, or a way for them to report any bugs that they may have found.

 + Mozila dev tools.

 Testing on all devices on mozila is good as well. 

## Project Bugs and Solutions:
 No known bugs now. But there were quite a few problems at every stage. Whenever a problem was fixed another woud apear. Here are some.

 * I had an issue with the JS validator, showing warnings about "jshint esversion: 6", this was a new one for me and took a while to figure out.
With the help of my mentor and the slack community I was able to resolve this.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Through mobile device, the website is not properly aligned. I am aware of this and i do not understand why under 320px the information is no longer centered sometimes. I hope with more time and better understanding of coding, I will be able to resolve this issue.

# Deployment

- To succsessfully deploy your webpage, go to the GitHub repository and navigate to the 'Settings' tab. Then, select 'Pages' from the menu.
- Go to the 'Source' menu and select 'Main Branch'.
- After the page has auto-refreshed, you should see a display with your link - this will mean a successful deployment.
- Now, any changes pushed from GitPod to the master branch will be visible and take effect on the live project [live project link](https://ankasendo.github.io/Star-Wars/)

### Photos/Images
The only Image I have used in my website is one taken from [ing.com](https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-movies-tv-shows-chronological-order) I used this from google images as it is a free site that allows you to download. 
I could not create my own as this is a TradeMark logo of the Star Wars franchise.
