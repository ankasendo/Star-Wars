 ### User preference
 I wanted the website to be aesthetically pleasing while using colours that are related to Star Wars theme. I wanted to keep the design minimal to not overwhelm the user while still being enjoyable to look at.
I wanted the user to be able to jusmp straight into the quiz with minimal navigation or extra pages blocking their path. I wanted this quiz to offer various questions that can be easy as well as challenging. T

 ### 1. Strategy 
 * Project Purpose
    *    To provide the target user with informative and fun quiz questions .

 ### 2. Scope
 * I wanted a simple, straightforward UX experience.
 * I wanted a bright fun color scheme.
 * I wanted my content to be clear for all users. 
 * I wanted a site that is visually appealing on most devices.

 ### 3. Structure
 *	A clear layout is in place to ensure users can immediately start the quiz.
 *  Multiple choice questions for faster interface

 ### 5. Surface

 * Colours

 I have paid a lot of attention to the color scheme. And used 3 colors throught the website. we've chosen Yellow, Blue as it is a good match for Star Wars scheme,and Black to contrast yellow and blue. 
 
 * Font Selection
 * Google font
 we've used Cormorant Garamond for the main font, and Lora as a backup font for this website. Both fonts are from the Serif font family. This was done to enhance the formalness and the seriousness of the topic, since this quiz is about tech comapanies.
 * The fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Potential Future Features

- A Timer  
      - A running timer during the activity could add some pressure and excitment to the challenge. Making the user more likely to continue replayability.

- Online Leaderboard
      - I would like to make the Leaderboard work and host online, this would connect more users and add even more challenge once more questions were added.

- Contact the Developer
      - This would be a way that the user could give more ideas on extra questions, or a way for them to report any bugs that they may have found.
